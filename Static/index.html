  			<h1>Warframe Review</h1>
		<p> Digital Extreme's new title marks an entry into a new world of third person shooter. One where melee combat and fast paced shooting
		mechanics are combined into one.

	<div class="well well-lg">
		<p style = "font-family:arial; font-size:16px;"> When I first entered Warframe I did so with a bit of a jaded view towards the title. I've seen other shooters try new concepts and crash and burn, especially in the
		MMO circuit. At first glance however, Warframe appears to do everything right.

<br/>
<p>Digital Extremes takes advantage of their Evolution Engine to create a seamless graphical experience. You will watch your Ninja fly by as they shoot down security cameras, slice up enemy troops, and wall run to extraction.
  On maximum settings you can see the light from the discharge of your firearm reflect off your Warframe, and these effects look fantastic. However, does the beautiful appearance of this game carry over into its core?

    <h3 class="media-heading">Starting Warframes</h3>
   <h4>You have the choice of 3 different Warframes to begin with.</h4>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	<p>Of the 3 different starting Warframes, I picked the Mag Warframe to start with. This Warframe boasts powers of magnetism which can be used in both
	offensive and defensive situations. Each Warframe has four different powers. The fourth power can be set aside from the other three in its power and energy usage. The power
	that occupies this fourth slot is basically the "ultimate ability" for your Warframe. The abilities make for a nice touch in the game, allowing for a true difference in play style for different frames. However, one issue that hindered this
	mechanic during my gameplay was the reliance upon energy. The energy of your Warframe allows it to use its abilities. Unfortunately, energy does not simply recover, it must be picked up by random enemy drops while you prgoress through the level.
	Normally this is not a problem and you have enough energy to use your powers with a bit of freedom and clear the level. However, it was frustrating in the beginning of game when my Warframe could not hold much energy at all, so powers were rarely used.
	Nonetheless, this does not affect the other core mechanics of the game. The controls of the game are snappy and responsive. It is easy to go from shooting a Grineer with a pistol to slashing a Corpus Walker in two with your katana. The powers mentioned earlier are easily accessed with the number keys.</p>

		<p> Missions are available through the main screen which consists of projections of the various planets you can visit throughout the game. Overall the interface works
		, and I definitely give it points for creativity. However, sometimes the Zoom In and Zoom Out functions were not working correctly and I was forced to log in again
		to fix the problem. In addition, sometimes the planets drift close together, making it difficult to accurately select the one you want for a short period, though this is a rare issue.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		While Warframe looks and plays great, there were definitely aspects of the game that did not appeal to me. One such aspect is the grind required to make new Warframes. While a grind is completely
		understandable for such a large component of the game, The Warframe part blueprint drop is extremely low. In addition, the game does not adjust for already collected parts, so you might end up 
		with 3 Trinity Helmets before getting the Systems you need to complete your Warframe. The underlying issue within this process is the fact that the entire time you farming the game for these drops, you are just looking for blueprints. Blueprints for you Warframe blueprints. 
		This extra step makes the process tedious, as the player already has to pay credits and wait hours simply to craft the parts unless they use actual money to speed up the process. The weapon crafting system works very similarly except raw materials are used more often, in lieu of other blueprints. This makes crafting weapons much easier than 
		Warframes. Personally, I feel the design of the weapon crafting system is much better than that of the Warframe crafting system for those reasons. Just about every Warframe and weapon that can be crafted can also be purchased using "Platinum", the game's translation of actual money.</p>
